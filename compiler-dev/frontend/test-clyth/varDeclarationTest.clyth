# As a note, all default variable types are 64-bits unless type-overridden.
# The same applies to pointers, all are 64-bit pointers unless the element being pointed to is not 64-bit.
# ie: 10i32 is 32-bit integer vs 10 which is 64-bit integer
#     const ptr = *i8 is 8-bit pointer to an 8-bit integer vs let x = 10; const ptr = &x where ptr is a 64-bit pointer to 64-bit integer variable x
